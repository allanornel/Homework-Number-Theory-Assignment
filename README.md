# Number Theory Assignment

Number Theory assignment from the Discrete Mathematics course. This project involves generating and validating 101-digit palindromic numbers that meet specific conditions: multiples of 7, 11, and 73, using all digits from 0 to 9 at least 9 times, and no more than two consecutive identical digits.
